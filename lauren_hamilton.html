	<h3>School Life:</h3>
	<center><p>I'm also a part of the AoIT program at the school. AoIT stands for Academy of Information Technology, and in it you can take the multimedia route or coding route. I took the coding route which means that each year of highschool I will take a course on a coding language then test to be certified in that language. This is how my years will be layed out:</p></center>
